# TheOasis
A combination Choose Your Own Adventure of different games including:
Minecraft
Dungeons and Dragons(And part of my previous champaign)
MC Eternal(Minecraft Added Mods)

In this Adventure, we follow the user to a land called the Oasis, which is full of many mythical 
species from folklore and fairy tales. The user is a part of a secret military that is in charge of
protecting the city from treason, and terrorists. The user is trying to gain information about the
individual(s) who are trying to overthrow the government.

# Software
In this project, I used simple "if" statements and prompted the user to pick
between a few choices. Some choices were the good endings, and others were cliff hangers.
If I continued and make the project longer, I'd want to have a full path to the end, and not
just a "soft ending" where the story is not complete.
